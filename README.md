I was advised by a more experienced Engineer to start writing about my challenges and how I go about solving them. This will be a dev diary of sorts!

At this point I have already built out basic structure for the various pages in my portfolio (home, about, projects, contact). 

I'm currently working on my contact form. Last session, I was able to set and update my form state for name, email, and message. Each input had an anonymous function that would update it's respective property in the form state.

I have just refactored this approach into a function that can take any of the change in value and update the corresponding input. The resulting code is much easier to read.

Now to style the contact form. To begin, I'm going to aim for something simple like this: (https://sharethis.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Compass.png). I may opt for something sleeker in the future, but first I want to get all elements organized.
